Development process
-------------------

New features may be added via prior consultation with community.

Developers submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Forexcoin development team members is likely to simply pull it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change then it may or may not be added.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable.
